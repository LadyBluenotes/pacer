# Class: Throttler\<TFn, TArgs\>

Defined in: [throttler.ts:58](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/throttler.ts#L58)

A class that creates a throttled function.

Throttling ensures a function is called at most once within a specified time window.
Unlike debouncing which waits for a pause in calls, throttling guarantees consistent 
execution timing regardless of call frequency.

Supports both leading and trailing edge execution:
- Leading: Execute immediately on first call (default: true)
- Trailing: Execute after wait period if called during throttle (default: true)

For rate limiting or hard API limits, consider using RateLimiter instead.
For collapsing rapid-fire events, consider using Debouncer.

## Example

```ts
const throttler = new Throttler(
  (id: string) => api.getData(id), 
  { wait: 1000 } // Execute at most once per second
);

// First call executes immediately
throttler.maybeExecute('123');

// Subsequent calls within 1000ms are throttled
throttler.maybeExecute('123'); // Throttled
```

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

The type of function to throttle

• **TArgs** *extends* `Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

The type of the function's parameters

## Constructors

### new Throttler()

```ts
new Throttler<TFn, TArgs>(fn, options): Throttler<TFn, TArgs>
```

Defined in: [throttler.ts:68](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/throttler.ts#L68)

#### Parameters

##### fn

`TFn`

##### options

[`ThrottlerOptions`](../interfaces/throttleroptions.md) = `defaultOptions`

#### Returns

[`Throttler`](throttler.md)\<`TFn`, `TArgs`\>

## Methods

### cancel()

```ts
cancel(): void
```

Defined in: [throttler.ts:158](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/throttler.ts#L158)

Cancels any pending trailing execution and clears internal state.

If a trailing execution is scheduled (due to throttling with trailing=true), 
this will prevent that execution from occurring. The internal timeout and 
stored arguments will be cleared.

Has no effect if there is no pending execution.

#### Returns

`void`

***

### getExecutionCount()

```ts
getExecutionCount(): number
```

Defined in: [throttler.ts:81](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/throttler.ts#L81)

Returns the number of times the function has been executed

#### Returns

`number`

***

### getLastExecutionTime()

```ts
getLastExecutionTime(): number
```

Defined in: [throttler.ts:88](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/throttler.ts#L88)

Returns the last execution time

#### Returns

`number`

***

### maybeExecute()

```ts
maybeExecute(...args): void
```

Defined in: [throttler.ts:116](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/throttler.ts#L116)

Attempts to execute the throttled function. The execution behavior depends on the throttler options:

- If enough time has passed since the last execution (>= wait period):
  - With leading=true: Executes immediately
  - With leading=false: Waits for the next trailing execution

- If within the wait period:
  - With trailing=true: Schedules execution for end of wait period
  - With trailing=false: Drops the execution

#### Parameters

##### args

...`TArgs`

The arguments to pass to the throttled function

#### Returns

`void`

#### Example

```ts
const throttled = new Throttler(fn, { wait: 1000 });

// First call executes immediately
throttled.maybeExecute('a', 'b');

// Call during wait period - gets throttled
throttled.maybeExecute('c', 'd'); 
```
