# Function: rateLimit()

```ts
function rateLimit<TFn>(fn, options): (...args) => boolean
```

Defined in: [rate-limiter.ts:213](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/rate-limiter.ts#L213)

Creates a rate-limited function that will execute the provided function up to a maximum number of times within a time window.

Note that rate limiting is a simpler form of execution control compared to throttling or debouncing:
- A rate limiter will allow all executions until the limit is reached, then block all subsequent calls until the window resets
- A throttler ensures even spacing between executions, which can be better for consistent performance
- A debouncer collapses multiple calls into one, which is better for handling bursts of events

Consider using throttle() or debounce() if you need more intelligent execution control. Use rate limiting when you specifically
need to enforce a hard limit on the number of executions within a time period.

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

The function to rate-limit

### options

[`RateLimiterOptions`](../interfaces/ratelimiteroptions.md)

Configuration options including the maximum executions allowed and time window

## Returns

`Function`

A rate-limited version of the input function that will reject calls once the limit is reached

Attempts to execute the rate-limited function if within the configured limits.
Will reject execution if the number of calls in the current window exceeds the limit.

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`

The arguments to pass to the rate-limited function

### Returns

`boolean`

true if the function was executed, false if it was rejected due to rate limiting

### Example

```ts
const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(fn, { limit: 5, window: 1000 });

// First 5 calls will return true
rateLimiter.maybeExecute('arg1', 'arg2'); // true

// Additional calls within the window will return false
rateLimiter.maybeExecute('arg1', 'arg2'); // false
```

## Example

```ts
// Rate limit to 5 calls per minute
const rateLimited = rateLimit(makeApiCall, {
  limit: 5,
  window: 60000,
  onReject: ({ msUntilNextWindow }) => {
    console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${msUntilNextWindow}ms`);
  }
});

// First 5 calls will execute immediately
// Additional calls will be rejected until the minute window resets
rateLimited();

// For more even execution, consider using throttle instead:
const throttled = throttle(makeApiCall, { wait: 12000 }); // One call every 12 seconds
```
