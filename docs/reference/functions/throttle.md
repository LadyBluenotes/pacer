# Function: throttle()

```ts
function throttle<TFn>(fn, options): (...args) => void
```

Defined in: [throttler.ts:198](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/throttler.ts#L198)

Creates a throttled function that limits how often the provided function can execute.

Throttling ensures a function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting 
expensive operations or UI updates.

The throttled function can be configured to execute on the leading and/or trailing
edge of the throttle window via options.

For handling bursts of events, consider using debounce() instead. For hard execution
limits, consider using rateLimit().

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

The type of function to throttle

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

The function to throttle

### options

[`ThrottlerOptions`](../interfaces/throttleroptions.md)

Configuration options including wait time and execution behavior

## Returns

`Function`

A throttled version of the input function

Attempts to execute the throttled function. The execution behavior depends on the throttler options:

- If enough time has passed since the last execution (>= wait period):
  - With leading=true: Executes immediately
  - With leading=false: Waits for the next trailing execution

- If within the wait period:
  - With trailing=true: Schedules execution for end of wait period
  - With trailing=false: Drops the execution

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`

The arguments to pass to the throttled function

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
const throttled = new Throttler(fn, { wait: 1000 });

// First call executes immediately
throttled.maybeExecute('a', 'b');

// Call during wait period - gets throttled
throttled.maybeExecute('c', 'd'); 
```

## Example

```ts
// Basic throttling - max once per second
const throttled = throttle(updateUI, { wait: 1000 });

// Configure leading/trailing execution
const throttled = throttle(saveData, {
  wait: 2000,
  leading: true,  // Execute immediately on first call
  trailing: true  // Execute again after delay if called during wait
});
```
