# Function: asyncThrottle()

```ts
function asyncThrottle<TFn>(fn, options): (...args) => Promise<void>
```

Defined in: [async-throttler.ts:168](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-throttler.ts#L168)

Creates an async throttled function that limits how often the function can execute.
The throttled function will execute at most once per wait period, even if called multiple times.
If called while executing, it will wait until execution completes before scheduling the next call.

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `Promise`\<`any`\>

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

[`AsyncThrottlerOptions`](../interfaces/asyncthrottleroptions.md)

## Returns

`Function`

Attempts to execute the throttled function
If a call is already in progress, it may be blocked or queued depending on the `wait` option

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`

### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

## Example

```ts
const throttled = asyncThrottle(async () => {
  await someAsyncOperation();
}, { wait: 1000 });

// This will execute at most once per second
await throttled();
await throttled(); // Waits 1 second before executing
```
