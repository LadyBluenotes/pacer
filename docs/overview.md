TanStack Pacer is a comprehensive utility library designed to help developers manage the execution timing of functions across any JavaScript environment. It offers a robust suite of tools for controlling the pace of operations, whether you're working with vanilla JavaScript or a reactive framework like React.

## Key Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Enforce strict limits on how frequently functions can be called within a specified time window, ideal for managing API requests and preventing abuse.
- **Throttling**: Ensure function executions are evenly spaced over time, providing smooth and predictable execution patterns for UI updates and event handling.
- **Debouncing**: Delay function execution until a specified period of inactivity, perfect for optimizing user input handling and reducing unnecessary operations.
- **Queueing**: Guarantee that every operation is processed in order, with support for FIFO, LIFO, and priority-based execution, ensuring no data loss in critical applications.
- **Async Support**: Seamlessly handle asynchronous functions with built-in support for promises and async/await, ensuring smooth integration with modern JavaScript workflows.
- **Framework Adapters**: Leverage framework-specific hooks and utilities for React, Solid, and more, enabling easy integration into existing projects.
- **TypeScript-First**: Benefit from full type safety and detailed generics support, ensuring robust and maintainable code.

## Why Use TanStack Pacer?

- **Performance Optimization**: Prevent expensive operations from executing too frequently, enhancing application performance.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Improve user experience by smoothing out interactions like typing, scrolling, and resizing.
- **API Rate Control**: Manage API call frequency to comply with rate limits and avoid service disruptions.
- **Resource Management**: Control the execution of resource-intensive operations to maintain application stability.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently group and process operations, reducing overhead and improving throughput.

TanStack Pacer is designed to integrate seamlessly with other TanStack libraries and can be used in any modern JavaScript application. Its modular architecture allows you to import only the components you need, keeping your bundle size minimal and your application efficient.
