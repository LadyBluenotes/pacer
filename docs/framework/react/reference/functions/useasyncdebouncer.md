# Function: useAsyncDebouncer()

```ts
function useAsyncDebouncer<TFn, TArgs>(fn, options): object
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts:45](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-debouncer/useAsyncDebouncer.ts#L45)

A low-level React hook that creates an `AsyncDebouncer` instance to delay execution of an async function.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a debouncer instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).

Async debouncing ensures that an async function only executes after a specified delay has passed since its last invocation.
This is useful for handling fast-changing inputs like search fields, form validation, or any scenario where you want to
wait for user input to settle before making expensive async calls.

The hook returns an object containing:
- maybeExecute: The debounced async function that respects the configured delay
- cancel: A function to cancel any pending delayed execution
- getExecutionCount: A function that returns the number of times the debounced function has executed

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

• **TArgs** *extends* `any`[]

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`AsyncDebouncerOptions`

## Returns

`object`

### cancel()

```ts
readonly cancel: () => void;
```

Cancels any pending execution

#### Returns

`void`

### getExecutionCount()

```ts
readonly getExecutionCount: () => number;
```

Returns the number of times the function has been executed

#### Returns

`number`

### maybeExecute()

```ts
readonly maybeExecute: (...args) => Promise<void>;
```

Attempts to execute the debounced function
If a call is already in progress, it will be queued

#### Parameters

##### args

...`TArgs`

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call debouncing
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncDebouncer(
  async (query: string) => {
    const results = await api.search(query);
    return results;
  },
  { wait: 500 }
);

// With state management
const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncDebouncer(
  async (searchTerm) => {
    const data = await searchAPI(searchTerm);
    setResults(data);
  },
  {
    wait: 300,
  }
);
```
