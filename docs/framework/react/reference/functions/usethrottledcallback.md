# Function: useThrottledCallback()

```ts
function useThrottledCallback<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
   selector): (...args) => void
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/throttler/useThrottledCallback.ts:61](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/throttler/useThrottledCallback.ts#L61)

A React hook that creates a throttled version of a callback function.
This hook is essentially a wrapper around the basic `throttle` function
that is exported from `@tanstack/pacer`,
but optimized for React with reactive options and a stable function reference.

The throttled function will execute at most once within the specified wait time period,
regardless of how many times it is called. If called multiple times during the wait period,
only the first invocation will execute, and subsequent calls will be ignored until
the wait period has elapsed.

This hook provides a simpler API compared to `useThrottler`, making it ideal for basic
throttling needs. However, it does not expose the underlying Throttler instance.

## State Management and Re-renders

**By default, this callback hook disables re-renders from internal throttler state changes**
for optimal performance. The callback function reference remains stable regardless of
internal state changes. However, you can opt into re-renders by providing a custom
`selector` function that returns the specific state values you want to track.

For advanced usage requiring features like:
- Manual cancellation
- Access to execution counts
- Custom useCallback dependencies

Consider using the `useThrottler` hook instead.

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* `AnyFunction`

• **TSelected** = \{\}

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`ThrottlerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

`Function`

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`void`

## Example

```tsx
// Throttle a window resize handler (no re-renders from internal state)
const handleResize = useThrottledCallback(() => {
  updateLayoutMeasurements();
}, {
  wait: 100 // Execute at most once every 100ms
});

// Opt into re-renders when execution count changes
const handleResize = useThrottledCallback(() => {
  updateLayoutMeasurements();
},
{ wait: 100 },
(state) => ({ executionCount: state.executionCount })
);

// Use in an event listener
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, [handleResize]);
```
