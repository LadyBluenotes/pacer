# Function: useDebouncedCallback()

```ts
function useDebouncedCallback<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
   selector): (...args) => void
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncedCallback.ts:60](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncedCallback.ts#L60)

A React hook that creates a debounced version of a callback function.
This hook is essentially a wrapper around the basic `debounce` function
that is exported from `@tanstack/pacer`,
but optimized for React with reactive options and a stable function reference.

The debounced function will only execute after the specified wait time has elapsed
since its last invocation. If called again before the wait time expires, the timer
resets and starts waiting again.

This hook provides a simpler API compared to `useDebouncer`, making it ideal for basic
debouncing needs. However, it does not expose the underlying Debouncer instance.

## State Management and Re-renders

**By default, this callback hook disables re-renders from internal debouncer state changes**
for optimal performance. The callback function reference remains stable regardless of
internal state changes. However, you can opt into re-renders by providing a custom
`selector` function that returns the specific state values you want to track.

For advanced usage requiring features like:
- Manual cancellation
- Access to execution counts
- Custom useCallback dependencies

Consider using the `useDebouncer` hook instead.

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* `AnyFunction`

• **TSelected** = \{\}

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`DebouncerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

`Function`

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`void`

## Example

```tsx
// Debounce a search handler (no re-renders from internal state)
const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((query: string) => {
  fetchSearchResults(query);
}, {
  wait: 500 // Wait 500ms between executions
});

// Opt into re-renders when pending state changes
const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((query: string) => {
  fetchSearchResults(query);
},
{ wait: 500 },
(state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending })
);

// Use in an input
<input
  type="search"
  onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
/>
```
