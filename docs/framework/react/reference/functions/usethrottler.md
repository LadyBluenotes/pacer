# Function: useThrottler()

```ts
function useThrottler<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
selector?): ReactThrottler<TFn, TSelected>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/throttler/useThrottler.ts:101](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/throttler/useThrottler.ts#L101)

A low-level React hook that creates a `Throttler` instance that limits how often the provided function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc). For a simpler and higher-level hook that
integrates directly with React's useState, see useThrottledState.

Throttling ensures a function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting
expensive operations or UI updates.

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.

**By default, all state changes will trigger a re-render.** To optimize performance, you can
provide a selector function that returns only the specific state values your component needs.
The component will only re-render when the selected values change.

Available state properties:
- `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
- `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
- `lastExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the last function execution in milliseconds
- `nextExecutionTime`: Timestamp when the next execution can occur in milliseconds
- `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
- `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending')

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* `AnyFunction`

• **TSelected** = `ThrottlerState`\<`TFn`\>

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`ThrottlerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector?

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

[`ReactThrottler`](../../interfaces/reactthrottler.md)\<`TFn`, `TSelected`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic throttling with custom state - re-renders on any state change
const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
const throttler = useThrottler(setValue, { wait: 1000 });

// Only re-render when execution count changes (optimized for tracking executions)
const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
const throttler = useThrottler(
  setValue,
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({ executionCount: state.executionCount })
);

// Only re-render when throttling state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
const throttler = useThrottler(
  setValue,
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({
    isPending: state.isPending,
    status: state.status
  })
);

// Only re-render when timing information changes (optimized for timing displays)
const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
const throttler = useThrottler(
  setValue,
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({
    lastExecutionTime: state.lastExecutionTime,
    nextExecutionTime: state.nextExecutionTime
  })
);

// With any state manager
const throttler = useThrottler(
  (value) => stateManager.setState(value),
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
  }
);

// Access the selected state
const { executionCount, isPending } = throttler.state;
```
