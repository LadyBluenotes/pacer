# Function: useAsyncThrottler()

```ts
function useAsyncThrottler<TFn, TArgs>(fn, options): object
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottler.ts:53](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottler.ts#L53)

A low-level React hook that creates an `AsyncThrottler` instance to limit how often an async function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).

Async throttling ensures an async function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting expensive API calls,
database operations, or other async tasks.

The hook returns an object containing:
- maybeExecute: The throttled async function that respects the configured wait time
- cancel: A function to cancel any pending trailing execution
- getExecutionCount: A function that returns the number of times the throttled function has executed

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* (...`args`) => `any`

The type of async function to throttle

• **TArgs** *extends* `any`[]

The type of the function's parameters

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

The async function to throttle

### options

`AsyncThrottlerOptions`

Configuration options including wait time and execution behavior

## Returns

`object`

An object containing the throttled async function and control methods

### cancel()

```ts
readonly cancel: () => void;
```

Cancels any pending execution

#### Returns

`void`

### getExecutionCount()

```ts
readonly getExecutionCount: () => number;
```

Returns the number of times the function has been executed

#### Returns

`number`

### maybeExecute()

```ts
readonly maybeExecute: (...args) => Promise<void>;
```

Attempts to execute the throttled function
If a call is already in progress, it may be blocked or queued depending on the `wait` option

#### Parameters

##### args

...`TArgs`

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Basic API call throttling
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { wait: 1000 }
);

// With state management
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const { maybeExecute } = useAsyncThrottler(
  async (query) => {
    const result = await searchAPI(query);
    setData(result);
  },
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false  // Skip trailing edge updates
  }
);
```
