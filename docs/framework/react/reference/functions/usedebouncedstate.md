# Function: useDebouncedState()

```ts
function useDebouncedState<TValue>(value, options): readonly [TValue, (...args) => void, {
  cancel: () => void;
  getExecutionCount: () => number;
  maybeExecute: (...args) => void;
 }]
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncedState.ts:40](https://github.com/TanStack/bouncer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncedState.ts#L40)

A React hook that creates a debounced state value, combining React's useState with debouncing functionality.
This hook provides both the current debounced value and methods to update it.

The state value is only updated after the specified wait time has elapsed since the last update attempt.
If another update is attempted before the wait time expires, the timer resets and starts waiting again.
This is useful for handling frequent state updates that should be throttled, like search input values
or window resize dimensions.

The hook returns a tuple containing:
- The current debounced value
- A function to update the debounced value
- The debouncer instance with additional control methods

## Type Parameters

â€¢ **TValue**

The type of value being debounced

## Parameters

### value

`TValue`

The initial value

### options

`DebouncerOptions`

Configuration options including wait time and maxWait

## Returns

readonly \[`TValue`, (...`args`) => `void`, \{
  `cancel`: () => `void`;
  `getExecutionCount`: () => `number`;
  `maybeExecute`: (...`args`) => `void`;
 \}\]

A tuple containing the debounced value, update function, and debouncer instance

## Example

```tsx
// Debounced search input
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm, debouncer] = useDebouncedState('', {
  wait: 500 // Wait 500ms after last keystroke
});

// Update value - will be debounced
const handleChange = (e) => {
  setSearchTerm(e.target.value);
};

// Get number of times the debounced function has executed
const executionCount = debouncer.getExecutionCount();
```
