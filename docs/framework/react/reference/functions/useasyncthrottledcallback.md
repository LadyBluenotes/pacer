# Function: useAsyncThrottledCallback()

```ts
function useAsyncThrottledCallback<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
selector): (...args) => Promise<ReturnType<TFn>>
```

Defined in: [react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottledCallback.ts:65](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/react-pacer/src/async-throttler/useAsyncThrottledCallback.ts#L65)

A React hook that creates a throttled version of an async callback function.
This hook is a convenient wrapper around the `useAsyncThrottler` hook,
providing a stable, throttled async function reference for use in React components.

The throttled async function will execute at most once within the specified wait time period,
regardless of how many times it is called. If called multiple times during the wait period,
only the first invocation will execute, and subsequent calls will be ignored until
the wait period has elapsed. The returned function always returns a promise
that resolves or rejects with the result of the original async function.

This hook provides a simpler API compared to `useAsyncThrottler`, making it ideal for basic
async throttling needs. However, it does not expose the underlying AsyncThrottler instance.

For advanced usage requiring features like:
- Manual cancellation
- Access to execution/error state
- Custom useCallback dependencies

Consider using the `useAsyncThrottler` hook instead.

## State Management and Re-renders

**By default, this callback hook disables re-renders from internal state changes for optimal performance.**
The hook uses TanStack Store internally but doesn't subscribe to state changes, preventing
unnecessary re-renders when the async throttler's internal state updates.

If you need to react to state changes (like showing loading indicators or error states),
you can provide a custom `selector` function to opt into specific state updates:

```tsx
// Default: No re-renders from state changes (optimal performance)
const throttledCallback = useAsyncThrottledCallback(asyncFn, { wait: 1000 });

// Opt-in: Re-render when execution state changes
const throttledCallback = useAsyncThrottledCallback(
  asyncFn,
  { wait: 1000 },
  (state) => ({ isExecuting: state.isExecuting, lastError: state.lastError })
);
```

## Type Parameters

• **TFn** *extends* `AnyAsyncFunction`

• **TSelected** = \{\}

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`AsyncThrottlerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

`Function`

### Parameters

#### args

...`Parameters`\<`TFn`\>

### Returns

`Promise`\<`ReturnType`\<`TFn`\>\>

## Example

```tsx
// Throttle an async API call
const handleApiCall = useAsyncThrottledCallback(async (data) => {
  const result = await sendDataToServer(data);
  return result;
}, {
  wait: 200 // Execute at most once every 200ms
});

// Use in an event handler
<button onClick={() => handleApiCall(formData)}>Send</button>
```
